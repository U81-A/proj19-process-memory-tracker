#### Main Topic: process-memory-tracker (实时统计进程内存使用及检测内存泄漏)

## Project Background and Description:

> According to the project description in the github repository, consult relevant materials to improve the project background.

background:

现在linux统计进程内存的方法 的优点和缺点

内存泄漏是什么为什么发生以及现在的检测方法

## Implementation

> According to the project background and expected goals, clarify the technical route, list the main technologies used in the project, and the main innovation points.

### Technical Route and Technologies

Based on knowledge and technologies of Linux and Linux kernel, we will try to use C or C++ to write the main logic code. Besides, some shell scripts may be generated as well. We will use github repository as our code storage. Some techniques in the background part of this document may be used for references. And we may use vim, clion or VS code as our development tools to write codes.



### Main Innovation Points

There are several innovation points we propose to implement. Firstly, we think about the features of our primary objective, real-time statistics of system processes and their thread memory usage. We would make the display available for sorting based on different conditions and make it a real-time display with refresh rate set by the user. Secondly, we will also try to make our algorithm and design more efficient and reliable, both for our primary goals and attempt goals.

实时统计系统进程及其中线程内存使用情况：

- 排序方式可选择
- 实时显示或静态显示





## Expected Goals

> The expected goals can be the expected goals listed in the repository, or based on the project background, put forward your own ideas and propose suitable project goals.

### Expected goal 1:

实时统计系统进程及其中线程内存使用情况

- 编码来实现对于内存使用信息的统计，并对内存统计数据进行进行排序并实时显示；

### Expected goal 2:

检测某个进程中的内存分配释放

- 编码实现检测具体进程中内存分配与释放；
- 编码实现检测具体进程中文件句柄的分配与释放；

### Expected goal 3:

检测某个进程中的内存是否存在泄漏

- 统计进程内存分配和释放的情况，确认是否存在泄漏情况，如有泄漏指出泄漏可疑处代码；

## Division of Labor

> List the main division of labor for each team member

We would search the relative materials and analyze the approaches to the implementation together. And then we can determine the specific division of labor for our team.
