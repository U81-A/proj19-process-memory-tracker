We select problem 1 as our primary task, that is, we will implement a program to record information of memory usage, then sort and display these information in real time. This program can also output these information to a file.

We will also discover relation between problem 1 and problem 2 3, and try to complete part of them according our ability and time. We will attempt to  add these modules to our program, such as tracking specific thread in a process, detect memory leak, find the suspected memory leak segment.

Our specific design goals are as follows.

Program primary goals:

- record information of memory usage for all processes in Linux
- sort and display these information in real time
- output the selected information to a file

Program attempt goals:

- detect memory leak in Linux
- locate potential segment causing memory leak
- detect detailed memory allocation and release for a specific process
- tracking memory usage of specific thread in a process
